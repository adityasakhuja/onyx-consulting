When my friend's dad reached out looking for an online presence for his new business, I was presented with a straightforward brief: 

- 🤘🏻 Keep it super simple
- 🏋️ Keep it lightweight

There were several ways I could go about it, using one of the many libraries and frameworks I have been delving into lately. In the end, I decided to go with a counterintuitive approach of coding this website completely from scratch using nothing but HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS. 

More than anything, I am looking at this as a fun challenge to really put my core fundamentals to work. Being an unpaid project, and my first as I foray back into this field, I have come up with a few simple goals I want to achieve through this:

- 💻 Minimise the use of libraries and write as much of the CSS and JS myself
- 📱 Make it 100% responsive and monbile-friendly
- ⚡ Make it lightweight and quick

I have *absolutely* no idea how this is gonna go, but I'm certainly looking forward to it!
